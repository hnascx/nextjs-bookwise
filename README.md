# BookWise

A fullstack application developed using Next.js, TypeScript, and StitchesJS for styling. Prisma was used as the ORM, and SQLite served as the database. Additionally, React Query and Axios were utilized to handle API requests, and Zod was employed for form validation. Login functionality was implemented with GitHub and Google authentication using NextAuth.

The developed platform is designed for posting book reviews, allowing users to rate books from 1 to 5 stars and share their comments.
